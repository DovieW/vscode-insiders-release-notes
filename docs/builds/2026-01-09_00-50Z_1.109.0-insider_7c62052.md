Version: `1.109.0-insider` · Branch: `main` · Upstream: [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

## Release Notes

## Accessibility

- Added automated accessibility tests using `axe-core` to the smoke test suite, covering workbench, activity bar, sidebar, status bar, and chat panel with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks. [#286446](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286446)  
- Fixed announcing cursor position on Windows, improving support for NVDA and macOS VoiceOver users. [#286586](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286586)  
- Fixed progress sound playback when re-entering a backgrounded chat session with a request still in progress. [#286428](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286428)  

## Terminal & Suggestion UX

- Terminal suggest now selects the first item with full background highlighting when triggered explicitly (e.g., Ctrl+Space), ensuring immediate acceptance with Enter. Maintains existing behavior for automatic triggers. [#286418](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286418)  
- Hid selection mode options in the terminal suggest toolbar when quick suggestions are disabled to reduce UI clutter. [#286441](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286441)  
- Fixed newline formatting in the terminal suggest details widget's explain mode for clearer display. [#286584](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286584)  

## Workbench & Chat

- Trimmed start of commands before rendering in chat terminal parts for cleaner output. [#286599](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286599)  

## Package Management

- Added readonly and lock file commands for npm, yarn, and pnpm package managers. [#286612](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286612)  

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- Fixed visibility settings on cached MCP tools. [#286643](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286643)  
- Improved `start all servers` command to use a special `"*"` value to indicate starting all servers and added a `waitForLiveTools` parameter to block until tools are available. [#286624](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286624)  

## Configuration & Settings

- Added `enforceModelTimeout` setting to allow more control over model timeouts. [#286607](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286607)  

## Dependencies

- Updated `@vscode/sudo-prompt` dependency to version 9.3.2. [#286557](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/286557)  

## Other
